        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          As an accomplished software engineer, I am deeply committed to
          delivering outstanding results with a keen focus on customer needs. My
          expertise spans across web development, particularly in frontend and
          backend-as-frontend (BFF) applications, where I have worked on
          numerous projects. This experience has honed my skills in creating
          seamless and efficient user experiences. Recently, I have expanded my
          skill set into the data engineering domain, specializing in functional
          programming with Scala and leveraging Apache Flink for sophisticated
          data processing. Known for my rapid learning capabilities and diligent
          work ethic, I am intensely self-motivated, constantly seeking new
          challenges and opportunities to grow. Alongside a strong commitment to
          team collaboration, I consistently strive to blend technical acumen
          with practical applications to drive business value.

            Quokka Parking was an innovative shared parking web app aimed at

            to the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the

            adaptability.
