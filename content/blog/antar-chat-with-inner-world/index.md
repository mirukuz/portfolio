Intrigued by the concept of "Antar: Chat with Inner World," a unique app facilitating self-reflection and internal dialogue, I proactively reached out to the founder in the US to propose the development of a desktop version. Collaborating closely with the team, I contributed my expertise and vision to this innovative project.
Over a three-month period, I single-handedly developed the macOS application from scratch.
