My journey into the world of 3D modeling began out of sheer curiosity and a passion for creative expression. I self-taught myself the intricacies of Blender, a powerful open-source 3D creation suite, and Nomad, an intuitive 3D sculpting tool designed for the iPad. Both platforms allowed me to experiment and bring my ideas to life in a digital three-dimensional space.

Learning these tools was a rewarding experience, enabling me to create a wide range of artwork from initial sketches to polished 3D models. Each project was a stepping stone, allowing me to refine my skills and expand my understanding of 3D design principles.
